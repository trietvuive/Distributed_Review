Defintion:
Clock skew: difference between time on two clocks
Clock drift: difference between clock rates on two clock (e.g. one clock is running faster than the other)

Cristian:
1) Client sends request for clock time to server at T0.
2) Server responds with clock time T_server, client receives at T1.
3) Client calculates the synchronized clock time as:

T_client = T_server + (T1 - T0)/2

T1 - T0 = combined time taken by the network to send the request and receive the response = round trip time (RTT)

To improve, take multiple readings and use the minimum RTT

Berkeley:
1) Node chosen as master node. Decide through consensus
2) Master pings everyone else to get clock time
3) Master calculates average time difference between all times received and master's own sysclock
4) Master adds this time difference to its own sysclock and broadcast to network
