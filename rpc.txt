RPC: Execute a subrountine on a different address space (e.g. a different computer), coded as a local procedure call

RPC caller sends request to RPC server. If async call, caller continues. If sync call, caller waits for response.

Defintion:
Stub: Translate local procedure call into a remote procedure call
Marshalling: Translate parameters into a form that can be sent over the network

Steps:
1. Client calls client stub with normal procedure call
2. Stub marshals parameter, make syscall to send message
3. Client's OS sends message to server's OS
4. Server's OS sends message to server stub
5. Server stub unmarshals parameter, calls server procedure
6. Server procedure returns result to server stub

Issues: 

1. How does the client know who to call, and where is the service resides?
Dynamic binding: Client stub uses a name service to find the address of the server stub
Server exports an interface, registers it with the name service
Client imports the interface before communicate
